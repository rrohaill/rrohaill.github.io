## ‚ú® About The Project

This portfolio was created to be a central hub for my professional identity. It's a place where I can present my journey as a software developer, highlight my technical expertise, and provide a curated look at the projects I'm most proud of. The goal was to build a site that is not only informative but also visually appealing and easy to navigate.

### Key Features:

* **Fully Responsive Design:** Looks great on all devices, from mobile phones to desktops.
* **Structured Sections:** Clear and concise sections for an introduction (Hero), About Me, Skills, Career Journey, and Featured Projects.
* **Modern Aesthetics:** Uses a clean layout, a professional font (Inter), and tasteful animations and hover effects.
* **Easy to Customize:** Built with standard HTML and Tailwind CSS, making it straightforward for other developers to adapt for their own use.
* **Contact Information:** Provides clear links to my professional profiles and email for easy contact.

## üöÄ Tech Stack

This project is built using a modern, lightweight tech stack focused on performance and ease of maintenance:

* **[HTML5](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Guide/HTML/HTML5):** For the core structure and content.
* **[Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/):** A utility-first CSS framework for rapid and responsive UI development. All styling is handled directly in the HTML via utility classes.
* **[JavaScript](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript):** For interactivity, including the mobile navigation menu and smooth scrolling.
* **[Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com/):** Used for the icons throughout the site.
* **[Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/):** Specifically, the 'Inter' font family is used for clean and readable typography.
